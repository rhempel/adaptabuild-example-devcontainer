## Introduction

This repository is a recipe for building a devcontainer for experimenting
with adaptabuild in VSCode using Podman/Docker for container management.

:exclamation: Do not clone this repository or the container-base-images
repository until you have read the instructions on how to build a containerized
development environment, here https://github.com/rhempel/adaptabuild-example.

## Scripts

The `scripts` folder has some helpers to easily create desktop shortcuts
for the OpenOCD debugger for supported MCUs.
